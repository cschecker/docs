# Asset History

Asset history represents the `record of asset queries`.
In the asset history, you can check the query time, and the user who performed the query, navigate to a desired history, or delete a history.

1. Click the `Past Asset History Button` to view the asset history.

2. Click on the desired asset history to view its details. The most recent dates appear at the top.

<img width="400" src={assethistory2} alt="img" />

## Delete History

Click the `Trash Can Icon` on the history you want to delete.
